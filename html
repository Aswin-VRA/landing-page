          <p>
            Love of beauty is taste. The creation of beauty is art. There is no must in art because art is free.Painting is just another way of keeping a dairy.

            <h4>James McNeil Whistler</h4>
            <p>
              It seems as though James McNeil Whistler is saying the value found in art is not the work that goes into it but the sharing of a 
              perspective,througha visual medium.This kind of perspective is one that can last forever.

            <h4>Piet Mondrian</h4>
            <p>
              Piet Mondrian had a peculiar take on it.He classifies creating art almost as a spiritual experience as though there is a greater being doing the work.
              It is an incrredibly passive stance.

            <h4>Rembrandt van Rijn</h4>
            <p>
              Both nature and God were highly influential during the years Rembrandt created art,and they 
              continue to influence artand artists to this day.

            <h4>Jackson Pollock</h4>
            <p>
            If we were to ake this quote literally.we would have to infer that pollock is a series of paint splatters,and we know this is not the case.

            <h4>Frida Kahlo</h4>
            <p>
              And based on this quote by Frida, Kahlo,we would imagine her to be something much more macabre.

            <h4>Georgia O'Keeffe</h4>
            <p>
              This art quote by Georgia O'Keeffe tells us she too found art capable of expressing what she wanted to say better than words themselves.
